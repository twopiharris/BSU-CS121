# Open APIs

There is a great list of open API resources here:  
[public apis](https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists?tab=readme-ov-file)

Notes on these APIs.

* Look for authentication to be NO.  The other ones require an authentication key, which can be tricky
* Look at the link to see how the API works. Each one is different
* Learn how to build a URL for the API through the browser
* The pretty-print option in Chrome makes JSON easier to read
* Some APIs return plain text, some return JSON
* There is sometimes a fee for a lot of requests, so check for this before automating a lot of calls to an API
* Note that APIs do sometimes time out or go out of business, so you are relying on the kindness of others
